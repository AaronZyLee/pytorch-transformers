0,"SCENE: A middle-class English interior, with English armchairs. An English evening. Mr. Smith, an Englishman,seated in his English armchair and wearing English slippers, is smoking his English pipe and reading an Englishnewspaper, near an English fire. He is wearing English spectacles and a small gray English mustache. Beside him, inanother English armchair, Mrs. Smith, an Englishwoman, is darning some English socks. A long moment of Englishsilence. The English clock strikes 17 English strokes.","MRS. SMITH : There, it’s nine o’clock. We’ve drunk the soup, and eaten the fish and chips, and the English salad.The children have drunk English water. We’ve eaten well this evening. That’s because we live in the suburbs ofLondon and because our name is Smith.","MR. SMITH: [continues to read, clicks his tongue.]","MRS. SMITH: Potatoes are very good fried in fat; the salad oil was not rancid. The oil from the grocer at the corner is better quality than the oil from the grocer at the bottom of the street. However, I prefer not to tell them that their oil is bad.","MRS. SMITH: My uncle lives in the country, but that's none of the midwife's business.","MR. SMITH: [continues to read, clicks his tongue]",2
1,"MR. SMITH:       [continues to read, clicks his tongue]","MRS. SMITH: Mary did the potatoes very well, this evening. The last time she did not do them well. I do not likethem when they are well done.","MR. SMITH:       [continues to read, clicks his tongue]","MRS. SMITH: The fish was fresh. It made my mouth water. I had two helpings. No, three helpings. That made mego to the w.c. You also had three helpings. However, the third time you took less than the first two times, while as forme, I took a great deal more . I eat better than you this evening. Why is that? Usually, it is you who eats more. It isnot appetite you lack.",MR. SMITH:      [clicks his tongue],MR. SMITH: Crocodile!,1
2,"MRS. SMITH: Our little boy wanted to drink some beer; he’s going to love getting tiddly. He’s like you. At table didyou notice how he stared at the bottle? But I poured some water from the jug into his glass. He was thirsty and hedrank it. Helen is like me: she's a good manager, thrifty, plays the piano. She never asks to drink English beer. She'slike our little daughter who drinks only milk and eats only porridge. It's obvious that she's only two. She's namedPeggy. The quince and bean pie was marvelous. It would have been nice, perhaps, to have had a small glass ofAustralian Burgundy with the sweet, but I did not bring the bottle to the table because I did not wish to set the childrena bad example of gluttony. They must learn to be sober and temperate.","MR. SMITH [continues to read, clicks his tongue.]","MRS. SMITH: Mrs. Parker knows a Rumanian grocer by the name of Popesco Rosenfeld, who has just come fromConstantinople. He is a great specialist in yogurt. He has a diploma from the school of yogurt-making in Adrianople.Tomorrow I shall buy a large pot of native Rumanian yogurt from him. One doesn't often find such things here in thesuburbs of London.","MR. SMITH [continues to read, clicks his tongue.]",MRS. MARTIN: It's harder in the case of fires. The tariffs are too high!,"MRS. SMITH: Yogurt is excellent for the stomach, the kidneys, the appendicitis, and apotheosis. It was DoctorMackenzie-King who told me that, he's the one who takes care of the children of our neighbors, the Johns. He's a gooddoctor. One can trust him. He never prescribes any medicine that he's not tried out on himself first. Before operating onParker, he had his own liver operated on first, although he was not the least bit ill.",2
3,MRS. SMITH: Because the operation was successful in the doctor's case and it was not in Parker's.,MR. SMITH: Then Mackenzie is not a good doctor. The operation should have succeeded with both of them or elseboth should have died.,MRS. SMITH: Why?,"MR. SMITH: A conscientious doctor must die with his patient if they can't get well together. The captain of a ship goesdown with his ship into the briny deep, he does not survive alone.","MR. SMITH: And what is even more interesting is the fact that firemen's stories are all true, and they're based onexperience.",MRS. SMITH: One cannot compare a patient with a ship.,2
4,"MRS. SMITH: Ah! I hadn't thought of that. ..Perhaps it is true. ..And then, what conclusion do you draw from this?","MR. SMITH: All doctors are quacks. And all patients, too. Only the Royal Navy is honest in England.",MRS. SMITH: But not sailors.,MR. SMITH: Naturally [A pause. Still reading his paper:] Here's a thing I don't understand. In the newspaper theyalways give the age of deceased persons but never the age of the newly born. That doesn't make sense.,"FIRE CHIEF: Eh, well—is there a fire here?",MRS. SMITH: I never thought of that![Another moment of silence. The clock strikes seven times. Silence. The clock strikes three times. Silence. The clockdoesn't strike.],2
5,"MRS. SMITH: My God, the poor man! When did he die?",MR. SMITH: Why do you pretend to be astonished? You know very well that he's been dead these past two years.Surely you remember that we attended his funeral a year and a half ago.,"MRS. SMITH: Oh yes, of course I do remember. I remembered it right away, but I don't understand why you yourselfwere so surprised to see it in the paper.",MR. SMITH: It wasn't in the paper. It's been three years since his death was announced. I remembered it through anassociation of ideas.,"MRS. SMITH: In real life, one must look out of the window.",MRS. SMITH: What a pity! He was so well preserved.,2
6,MRS. SMITH: Poor Bobby.,MR. SMITH: Which poor Bobby do you mean?,"MRS. SMITH: It is his wife that I mean. She is called Bobby too, Bobby Watson. Since they both had the same name,you could never tell one from the other when you saw them together. It was only after his death that you could reallytell which was which. And there are still people today who confuse her with the deceased and offer their condolencesto him. Do you know her?","MR. SMITH: I only met her once, by chance, at Bobby's burial.",MRS. SMITH: I've never seen her. Is she pretty?,"MR. SMITH: Goodness, someone is ringing. There must be someone there.",1
7,"MRS. SMITH: And when do they plan to be married, those two?","MR. SMITH: Next spring, at the latest.","MRS. SMITH: We shall have to go to their wedding, I suppose.",MR. SMITH: We shall have to give them a wedding present. I wonder what?,MRS. SMITH: Are you referring to Bobby Watson the commercial traveler?,MRS. SMITH: Why don't we give them one of the seven silver salvers that were given us for our wedding and whichhave never been of any use to us? [Silence.],2
8,"MR. SMITH: Fortunately, they had no children.","MRS. SMITH: That was all they needed! Children! Poor woman, how could she have managed!",MR. SMITH: She's still young. She might very well remarry. She looks so well in mourning.,MRS. SMITH: But who would take care of the children? You know very well that they have a boy and a girl. What aretheir names?,"MR. SMITH: Bobby and Bobby like their parents. Bobby Watson's uncle, old Bobby Watson, is a rich man and veryfond of the boy. He might very well pay for Bobby's education.","MR. MARTIN: Paper is for writing, the cat's for the rat. Cheese is for scratching.",1
9,"MR. SMITH: Yes, a cousin of Bobby Watson's.",MRS. SMITH: Who? Bobby Watson?,MR. SMITH: Which Bobby Watson do you mean?,"MRS. SMITH: Why, Bobby Watson, the son of old Bobby Watson, the late Bobby Watson's other uncle.","MR. SMITH: No, it's not that one, it's someone else. It's Bobby Watson, the son of old Bobby Watson, the late BobbyWatson's aunt.",MR. SMITH: I'll go.[Mrs. Smith shrugs her shoulders. Mrs. Martin tosses her head.],1
10,MR. SMITH: All the Bobby Watsons are commercial travelers.,"MRS. SMITH: What a difficult trade! However, they do well at it.","MR. SMITH: Yes, when there's no competition.",MRS. SMITH: And when is there no competition?,"MRS. MARTIN: No, unfortunately.","MR. SMITH: On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Tuesdays.",2
11,"MR. SMITH: He rests, he sleeps.",MRS. SMITH: But why doesn't he work those three days if there's no competition?,MR. SMITH: I don't know everything. I can't answer all your idiotic questions!,MRS. SMITH [offended]: Oh! Are you trying to humiliate me?,MR. SMITH: And the newspaper.,MR. SMITH [all smiles]: You know very well that I'm not.,2
12,"MR. SMITH: But what would you say if you saw men acting like women do, smoking all day long, powdering,rouging their lips, drinking whisky?","MRS. SMITH: It's nothing to me! But if you're only saying that to annoy me ...I don't care for that kind of joking, youknow that very well![She hurls the socks across the stage and shows her teeth. She gets up.*]","MR. SMITH [also getting up and going towards his wife, tenderly]: Oh, my little ducky daddles, what a little spitfireyou are! You know that I only said it as a joke! [He takes her by the waist and kisses her.] What a ridiculous pair ofold lovers we are! Come, let's put out the lights and go bye-byes.","MARY [entering]: I'm the maid. I have spent a very pleasant afternoon. I've been to the cinema with a man and I'veseen a film with some women. After the cinema, we went to drink some brandy and milk and then read the newspaper.","MARY: I hope, madam and sir will excuse me ...and these ladies and gentlemen too. ..I would like. ..I would like ...totell you a story, myself.","MRS. SMITH: I hope that you've spent a pleasant afternoon, that you went to the cinema with a man and that youdrank some brandy and milk.",2
13,"MARY: Mr. and Mrs. Martin, your guests, are at the door. They were waiting for me. They didn't dare come in bythemselves. They were supposed to have dinner with you this evening.","MRS. SMITH: Oh, yes. We were expecting them. And we were hungry. Since they didn't put in an appearance, wewere going to start dinner without them. We've had nothing to eat all day. You should not have gone out!",MARY: But it was you who gave me permission.,"MR. SMITH: We didn't do it on purpose.* In Nicolas Bataille's production, Mrs. Smith did not show her teeth, nor.did she throw the socks very far.","FIRE CHIEF [he is of course in uniform and is wearing an enormous shining helmet]: Good evening, ladies andgentlemen. [The Smiths and the Martins are still slightly astonished. Mrs. Smith turns her head away, in a temper, anddoes not reply to his greeting.] Good evening, Mrs. Smith. You appear to be angry.","MARY [bursts into laughter, then she bursts into tears. Then she smiles]: I bought me a chamber pot.",2
14,"MARY: Why have you come so late! You are not very polite. People should be punctual. Do you understand? But sitdown there, anyway, and wait now that you're here.[She exits. Mr. and Mrs. Martin sit facing each other, without speaking. They smile timidly at each other. The dialoguewhich follows must be spoken in voices that are drawling, monotonous, a little singsong, without nuances.*]","MR. MARTIN: Excuse me, madam, but it seems to me, unless I'm mistaken, that I've met you somewhere before.","MRS. MARTIN: I, too, sir. It seems to me that I've met you somewhere before.","MR. MARTIN: Was it, by any chance, at Manchester that I caught a glimpse of you, madam?MRS. MAR TIN: That is very possible. I am originally from the city of Manchester. But I do not have a good memory,sir. I cannot say whether it was there that I caught a glimpse of you or not!","MR. MARTIN: Good God, that's curious! I, too, am originally from the city of Manchester, madam!","MRS. SMITH: Who, What?",1
15,"MR. MARTIN: Isn't that curious! Only, I, madam, I left the city of Manchester about five weeks ago.","MRS. MARTIN: That is curious! What a bizarre coincidence! I, too, sir, I left the city of Manchester about five weeksago.","MR. MARTIN: Madam, I took the 8:30 morning train which arrives in London at 4:45.","MRS. MARTIN: That is curious! How very bizarre! And what a coincidence! I took the same train, sir, I too.","MR. MARTIN: Bizarre, beaux-arts, brassieres!","MR. MARTIN: Good Lord, how curious! Perhaps then, madam, it was on the train that I saw you?     *In Nicolas Bataille's production, this dialogue was spoken in a tone and played in a style sincerely tragic.",2
16,"MR. MARTIN: I traveled second class, madam. There is no second class in England, but I always travel second class.","MRS. MARTIN: That is curious! How very bizarre! And what a coincidence! I, too, sir, I traveled second class.","MR. MARTIN: How curious that is! Perhaps we did meet in second class, my dear lady!","MRS. MARTIN: That is certainly possible, and it is not at all unlikely. But I do not remember very well, my dear sir!","MARY: I'm going to recite a poem, then, is that agreed? It is a poem entitled ""The Fire"" in honor of the Fire Chief:                                                      The Fire                                       The polypoids were burning in the wood                                                 A stone caught fire                                                The castle caught fire                                                The forest caught fire                                                The men caught fire                                               The women caught fire                                                The birds caught fire                                                 The fish caught fire                                                The water caught fire                                                 The sky caught fire                                                The ashes caught fire                                               The smoke caught fire                                                 The fire caught fire                                               Everything caught fire![She recites the poem while the Smiths are pushing her offstage]","MR. MARTIN: My seat was in coach No.8, compartment 6, my dear lady.",2
17,"MR. MARTIN: How curious that is and what a bizarre coincidence! Perhaps we met in compartment 6, my dear lady?","MRS. MARTIN: It is indeed possible, after all! But I do not recall it, my dear sir!","MR. MARTIN: To tell the truth, my dear lady, I do not remember it either, but it is possible that we caught a glimpseof each other there, and as I think of it, it seems to me even very likely.","MRS. MARTIN: Oh! truly, of course, truly, sir!","MR. MARTIN: How curious it is! I had seat No.3, next to the window, my dear lady.","FIRE CHIEF: Don't get excited. You tell me, Mrs. Smith.",1
18,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is! It is possible, but I do not recall it, sir!","MR. MARTIN: To tell the truth, my dear lady, I do not remember it either. However, it is very possible that we saweach other on that occasion.","MRS. MARTIN: It is true, but I am not at all sure of it, sir.","MR. MARTIN: Dear madam, were you not the lady who asked me to place her suitcase in the luggage rack and whothanked me and gave me permission to smoke?",MRS. SMITH: And I was saying that each time the doorbell rings there is never anyone there.,"MRS. MARTIN: But of course, that must have been I, sir. How curious it is, how curious it is, and what a coincidence!",2
19,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is and what a coincidence! It is indeed possible, my dear sir! However, I do notbelieve that I recall it.","MR. MARTIN: Nor do I, madam. [A moment of silence. The clock strikes twice, then once.] Since coming to London, Ihave resided in Bromfield Street, my dear lady.","MRS. MARTIN: How curious that is, how bizarre! I, too, since coming to London, I have resided in Bromfield Street,my dear sir.","MR. MARTIN: How curious that is, well then, well then, perhaps we have seen each other in Bromfield Street, mydear lady.","MRS. MARTIN: How curious that is, how bizarre! It is indeed possible, after all! But I do not recall it, my dear sir.",MR. SMITH: Why do you pretend to be astonished? You know very well that he's been dead these past two years.Surely you remember that we attended his funeral a year and a half ago.,1
20,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious that is. I also reside at No. 19, my dear sir.","MR. MARTIN: Well then, well then, well then, well then, perhaps we have seen each other in that house, dear lady?","MRS. MARTIN: It is indeed possible but I do not recall it, dear sir.","MR. MARTIN: My flat is on the fifth floor, No.8, my dear lady.","MRS. MARTIN: Oh! truly, of course, truly, sir!","MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is, good Lord, how bizarre!And what a coincidence! I too reside on the fifth floor, in flat No.8, dear sir!",2
21,"MRS. MARTIN: What a coincidence, good Lord, what a coincidence! My bedroom, too, has a bed with a greeneiderdown and is at the end of the corridor, between the w.c., dear sir, and the bookcase!","MR. MARTIN: How bizarre, curious, strange! Then, madam, we live in the same room and we sleep in the same bed,dear lady. It is perhaps there that we have met!","MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is and what a coincidence! It is indeed possible that we have met there, and perhapseven last night. But I do not recall it, dear sir!","MR. MARTIN: I have a little girl, my little daughter, she lives with me, dear lady. She is two years old, she's blonde,she has a white eye and a red eye, she is very pretty, her name is Alice, dear lady.",MRS. MARTIN: Sainte-Nitouche stoops to my cartouche.,"MRS. MARTIN: What a bizarre coincidence! I, too, have a little girl. She is two years old, has a white eye and a redeye, she is very pretty, and her name is Alice, too, dear sir!",2
22,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is! It is indeed possible, dear sir. [A rather long moment of silence. The clock strikes29 times.]","MR. MARTIN [after having reflected at length, gets up slowly and, unhurriedly, moves toward Mrs. Martin, who,surprised by his solemn air, has also gotten up very quietly. Mr. Martin, in the same flat, monotonous voice, slightlysing- song]: Then, dear lady, I believe that there can be no doubt about it, we have seen each other before and you aremy own wife. ..Elizabeth, I have found you again![Mrs. Martin approaches Mr. Martin without haste. They embrace without expression. The clock strikes once, veryloud. This striking of the clock must be so loud that it makes the audience jump. The Martins do not hear it.]","MRS. MARTIN: Donald, it's you, darling![They sit together in the same armchair, their arms around each other, and fall asleep. The clock strikes several moretimes. Mary, on tiptoe, a finger to her lips, enters quietly and addresses the audience.]","MARY: Elizabeth and Donald are now too happy to be able to hear me. I can therefore let you in on a secret. Elizabethis not Elizabeth, Donald is not Donald. And here is the proof: the child that Donald spoke of is not Elizabeth'sdaughter, they are not the same person. Donald's daughter has one white eye and one red eye like Elizabeth's daughter.Whereas Donald's child has a white right eye and a red left eye, Elizabeth's child has a red right eye and a white lefteye! Thus all of Donald's system of deduction collapses when it comes up against this last obstacle which destroys hiswhole theory. In spite of the extraordinary coincidences which seem to be definitive proofs, Donald and Elizabeth, notbeing the parents of the same child, are not Donald and Elizabeth. It is in vain that he thinks he is Donald, it is in vainthat she thinks she is Elizabeth. He believes in vain that she is Elizabeth. She believes in vain that he is Donald -theyare sadly deceived. But who is the true Donald? Who is the true Elizabeth? Who has any interest in prolonging thisconfusion? I don't know. Let's not try to know. Let's leave things as they are. [She takes several steps toward the door,then returns and says to the audience:] My real name is Sherlock Holmes. [She exits.][The clock strikes as much as it likes. After several seconds, Mr. and Mrs. Martin separate and take the chairs they hadat the beginning.]",FIRE CHIEF: No.,"MR. MARTIN: Darling, let's forget all that has not passed between us, and, now that we have found each other again,let's try not to lose each other any more, and live as before.",2
23,"MRS. SMITH: Good evening, dear friends! Please forgive us for having made you wait so long. We thought that weshould extend you the courtesy to which you are entitled and as soon as we learned that you had been kind enough togive us the pleasure of coming to see us without prior notice we hurried to dress for the occasion.","MR. SMITH [furious]: We've had nothing to eat all day. And we've been waiting four whole hours for you. Why haveyou come so late?[Mr. and Mrs. Smith sit facing their guests. The striking of the clock underlines the speeches, more or less strongly,according to the case. The Martins, particularly Mrs. Martin, seem embarrassed and timid. For this reason theconversation begins with, difficulty and the words are uttered, at the be ginning, awkwardly. A long embarrassedsilence at first, then other silences and hesitations follow.]",MR. SMITH: Hm. [Silence.],"MRS. SMITH: Hm, hm. [Silence.]","MRS. MARTIN: Hm, hm, hm. [Silence.]",MRS. SMITH: It was in all the papers.,1

MARTIN [graciously]: Oh, well today I witnessed something extraordinary. Something really incredible.",MRS. SMITH: Begin!,"MR. MARTIN: Tell us quickly, my dear.",2
28,"MRS. SMITH: At last.MRS MARTIN: Well, today, when I went shopping to buy some vegetables, which are getting to be dearer anddearer…MRS SMITH: Where is it all going to end?","MR. SMITH: You shouldn’t interrupt, my dear, it’s very rude.","MRS. MARTIN: In the street, near a café, I saw a man, properly dressed, about fifty years old, or not even that, who…","MR.

45,MR. MARTIN [to the Fire Chief]: But the third time--it was not you who rang?,"FIRE CHIEF: Yes, it was I.",MR. SMITH: But when the door was opened nobody was in sight.,FIRE CHIEF: That was because I had hidden myself—as a joke.,"MRS. SMITH: Don't make jokes, Mr. Fire Chief. This business is too sad.",MR.

51,FIRE CHIEF: No floods either.,MRS. SMITH: But there is some sugar.,MR. SMITH: That's because it is imported.,MRS. MARTIN: It's harder in the case of fires. The tariffs are too high!,"FIRE CHIEF: All the same, there's an occasional asphyxiation by gas, but that's unusual too.

53,MR. SMITH: Go see the Durands.,"FIRE CHIEF: I can't do that either. He's not English. He's only been naturalized. And naturalized citizens have theright to have houses, but not the right to have them put out if they're burning.","MRS.

As a result, it was obliged to give birth. It brought forth acow into the world. However, since the calf was male, the cow could not call him Mamma. Nor could she call himPapa, because the calf was too little. The calf was then obliged to get married and the registry office carried out all thedetails completely a la mode.","MRS.

""Afox doesn't give money,"" replied the tricky animal, who, in order to escape, jumped down into a deep ravine full ofstrawberries and chicken honey. But the snake was there waiting for him with a Mephistophelean laugh. The fox pulledout his knife, shouting: ""I'm going to teach you how to live!"" Then he took to flight, turning his back. But he had noluck. The snake was quicker. With a well-chosen blow of his fist, he struck the fox in the middle of his forehead, whichbroke into a thousand pieces, while he cried: ""No! No!
