them. We do not see the judge. He speaks in slow, measured tones, and his voice is grave. The camera drifts
over the faces of the jurymen as the judge speaks, and we see that most of their heads are turned to camera's
left. NO. 7 looks down at his hands. NO. 3 looks off in another direction, the direction in which the defendant
would be sitting. NO. 10 keeps moving his head back and forth nervously. The judge drones on.","
JUDGE: Murder in the first degree—premeditated homicide—is the most serious charge tried in our criminal
courts. You've heard a long and complex case, gentlemen, and it is now your duty to sit down to try and
separate the facts from the fancy. One man is dead. The life of another is at stake. If there is a reasonable doubt
in your minds as to the guilt of the accused . . . then you must declare him not guilty. If, however, there is no
reasonable doubt, then he must be found guilty. Whichever way you decide, the verdict must be unanimous. I
urge you to deliberate honestly and thoughtfully. You are faced with a grave responsibility. Thank you,
gentlemen.",[There is a long pause.],CLERK: (droning). The jury will retire.,"NO. 3: Look, you're not going to be satisfied till you see it again. I'm going to give you a demonstration.

box and off camera to the left. Camera holds on jury box, and then fades out].",2
1,"[Fade in on a large bare, unpleasant-looking room. This is the jury room in the county criminal court of a large
Eastern city. It is about 4:00 P.M. The room is furnished with a long conference table and a dozen chairs. The
walls are bare, drab and badly in need of a fresh coat of paint. Along one wall is a row of windows, which look
out on the skyline of the city's financial district. High on another wall is an electric clock. A washroom opens off
the jury room. In one corner of the room is a water fountain. On the table are pads, pencils, and ashtrays. One
of the windows is open. Papers blow across the table and onto the floor as the door opens. Lettered on the
outside of the door are the words ""Jury Room"". A uniformed guard holds the door open. Slowly, almost self-
consciously, the twelve jurors file in. The guard counts them as they enter the door, his lips moving, but no
sound coming forth. Four or five of the jurors light cigarettes as they enter the room. Juror NO. 5 lights his
pipe, which he smokes constantly throughout the play. Jurors NO. 2 and 12 go to the water fountain. NO. 9
goes into the washroom, the door of which is lettered ""Men."" Several of the jurors take seats at the table. Others
stand awkwardly around the room. Several look out the windows. These are men who are ill at ease, who do not
really know each other to talk to and who wish they were anywhere but here. NO. 7, standing at window, takes
out a pack of gum, takes a piece, and offers it around. There are no takers. He mops his brow.]","NO. 7: (to NO. 6). Y' know something? It's hot. (NO. 6 nods.) You'd think they'd at least air condition the place.
I almost dropped dead in court.","[NO. 7 opens the window a bit wider. The guard looks them over and checks his count. Then, satisfied, he
makes ready to leave.]","GUARD: Okay, gentlemen. Everybody's here. If there's anything you want, I'm right outside. Just knock.

people lie. l don't have to tell you. They don't know what the truth is. And lemme tell you, they— (NO.5 gets up
from table, turns his back to it, and goes to window.)—don't need any real big reason to kill someone either.

are. You know what I mean? Violent!",1

dangerous killer. You could see it.",2
9,NO. 8: He's nineteen years old.,"NO. 3: That's old enough. He knifed his own father, four inches into the chest. An innocent little nineteen-year

without talking about it first.",NO. 7: Who says it's easy for me?,NO. 8: No one.,"NO. 7: What, just because I voted fast? I think the guy's guilty. You couldn't change my mind if you talked for a
hundred years.","NO. 3: All right, let's not be silly.","NO. 8: I don't want to change your mind. I just want to talk for a while. Look, this boy's been kicked around all
his life. You know, living in a slum, his mother dead since he was nine. That's not a very good head start. He's a
tough, angry kid. You know why slum kids get that way? Because we knock 'em on the head once a day, every
day. I think maybe we owe him a few words. That's all.",2

what that trial cost? He's lucky he got it. Look, we're all grownups here. You're not going to tell us that we're
supposed to believe him, knowing what he is. I've lived among 'em all my life. You can't believe a word they
say. You know that.","NO. 9: (to NO. 10 very slowly). I don't know that. What a terrible thing for a man to believe! Since when is
dishonesty a group characteristic? You have no monopoly on the truth.",NO. 3 {interrupting) All right. It's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.,NO. 9: What this man says is very dangerous.,"NO. 9: A few feet, maybe.",1

man. He draws a deep breath and relaxes.]",NO.4: I don't see any need for arguing like this.

Let's do it.,"NO. 8: This. An el train passes a given point in ten seconds. That given point is the window of the room in
which the killing took place. You can almost reach out of the window of that room and touch the el. Right?
(Several of them nod.) All right. Now let me ask you this. Did anyone here ever live right next to the el tracks? I
have. When your window is open and the train goes by, the noise is almost unbearable. You can't hear yourself
think.",1

this gentleman (indicating NO. 8) that we're right and he's wrong. Maybe if we each took a minute or two, you
know, if we sort of try it on for size.",FOREMAN: That sounds fair enough. Supposing we go once around the table.,[They quiet down.],"NO. 7: Okay, let's start it off.",2
14,FOREMAN: Right (To NO. 2) I guess you're first.,"NO.2: (timidly). Oh. Well . . . (Long pause) I just think he's guilty. I thought
it was obvious. I mean nobody proved otherwise.","NO. 8: (quietly). Nobody has to prove otherwise. The burden of proof is on the prosecution. The defendant
doesn't have to open his mouth. That's in the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment. You've heard of it.","NO. 2: (flustered). Well, sure, I've heard of it. I know what it is. I . . . what
I meant . . . well, anyway, I think he was guilty.",NO. 7: Ran. Walked. What's the difference? He got there.,"NO.3: Okay, let's get to the facts. Number one, let's take the old man who lived on the second floor right
underneath the room where the murder took place. At ten minutes after twelve on the night of the killing he
heard loud noises in the upstairs apartment. He said it sounded like a fight. Then he heard the kid say to his
father, ""I'm gonna kill you.!” A second later he heard a body falling, and he ran to the door of his apartment,
looked out, and saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house. Then he called the police. They found
the father with a knife in his chest.",2
15,FOREMAN: And the coroner fixed the time of death at around midnight.,NO.3: Right. Now what else do you want?,"NO. 4: The boy's entire story is flimsy. He claimed he was at the movies. That's a little ridiculous, isn't it? He
couldn't even remember what pictures he saw.",NO. 3: That's right. Did you hear that? (To NO. 4) You're absolutely right.,"NO. 10: Look, what about the woman across the street? If her testimony don't prove it, then nothing does.","[He speeds up his pace slightly. He reaches the door and turns now, heading back, hobbling as an old man
would hobble, bent over his imaginary canes. They watch him tensely. He hobbles back to the chair, which also
serves as the front door. He stops there and pretends to unlock the door. Then he pretends to push it open.]",1
16,"NO. 12: That's right. She saw the killing, didn't she?",FOREMAN: Let's go in order.,"NO. 10: (loud). Just a minute. Here's a woman who's lying in bed and can't sleep. It's hot, you know. (He gets
up and begins to walk around, blowing his nose and talking.) Anyway, she looks out the window and right
across the street she sees the kid stick the knife into his father. She's known the kid all his life. His window is
right opposite hers, across the el tracks, and she swore she saw him do it.",NO. 8: Through the windows of a passing elevated train.,NO. 3: The boy lied and you know it.,"NO. 10: Okay. And they proved in court that you can look through the windows of a passing el train at night
and see what's happening on the other side. They proved it.",2
17,"NO. 8: I'd like to ask you something. How come you believed her? She's one of ""them"" too, isn't she?",[NO. 10 walks over to NO. 8:],"NO. 10: (sarcastically) You're a pretty smart fellow, aren't you?",FOREMAN: (rising) Now take it easy.,[NO. 3 gets up and goes to NO. 10:],[He stops short just as the blade reaches NO. 8's chest.

19,"NO.6: (slowly). I don't know. I started to be convinced, you know, with the testimony from those people across
the hall. Didn't they say something about an argument between the father and the boy around seven o'clock that
night? I mean, I can be wrong.",NO.11: I think it was eight o'clock. Not seven.,"NO. 8: That's right. Eight o'clock. They heard the father hit the boy twice and then saw the boy walk angrily out
of the house. What does that prove?","NO. 6: Well, it doesn't exactly prove anything. It's just part of the picture. I didn't say it proved anything.",NO.5: Lawyers can't think of everything.,FOREMAN: Anything else?,2
20,NO. 6: No.,[NO. 6 goes to the water fountain.],FOREMAN: (to NO. 7). All right. How about you?,"NO.7: I don't know, most of it's been said already. We can talk all day about this thing, but I think we’re
wasting our time. Look at the kid's record. At fifteen he was in reform school. He stole a car. He's been arrested
for mugging. He was picked up for knife-fighting. I think they said he stabbed somebody in the arm. This is a
very fine boy.",NO. 3: How does he know how long fifteen seconds is? You can't judge that kind of a thing.,NO. 8: Ever since he was five years old his father beat him up regularly. He used his fists.,2
21,NO.7: So would I! A kid like that.,"NO. 3: You’re right. It's the kids. The way they are—you know? They don't listen. (Bitter) I've got a kid. When
he was eight years old, he ran away from a fight. I saw him. I was so ashamed, I told him right out, ""I'm gonna
make a man out of you or I'm gonna bust you up into little pieces trying."" When he was fifteen he hit me in the
face. He's big, you know. I haven't seen him in three years. Rotten kid! You work your heart out.... (Pause) All
right, let's get on with it.",[Looks away embarrassed.],"NO. 4: We're missing the point here. This boy—let's say he's a product of a filthy neighborhood and a broken
home. We can't help that. We're not here to go into the reasons why slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
They are. I know it. So do you. The children who come out of slum backgrounds are potential menaces to
society.",NO. 7: Guilty.,"NO. 10: You said it there. I don't want any part of them, believe me.",2

Maybe it still smells on me.,FOREMAN: Now let's be reasonable. There's nothing personal.,NO. 4: She did wear glasses. Funny. I never thought of it.,1
23,[NO. 5 stands up.],"NO. 5: There is something personal! [Then he catches himself and seeing everyone looking at him, sits down,
fists clenched.]","NO. 3: (persuasively). Come on, now. He didn't mean you, feller. Let's not be so sensitive.",[There is a long pause.],NO. 11: I can understand this sensitivity.,"NO. 8: (ignoring him). All right. This is the apartment in which the killing took place. The old man's apartment
is directly beneath it and exactly the same. (Pointing) Here are the el tracks. The bedroom. Another bedroom.
Living room. Bathroom. Kitchen. And this is the hall. Here’s the front door to the apartment. And here are the
steps. (Pointing to front bedroom and then front door) Now, the old man was in bed in this room. He says he
got up, went out into the hall, down the hall to the front door, opened it, and looked out just in time to see the
boy racing down the stairs. Am I right?",1
24,FOREMAN: Now let's stop the bickering. We're wasting time. (To NO. 8) It's your turn.,"NO. 8: All right. I had a peculiar feeling about this trial. Somehow I felt that the defense counsel never really
conducted a thorough cross-examination. I mean, he was appointed by the court to defend the boy. He hardly
seemed interested. Too many questions were left unasked.","NO. 3 (annoyed). What about the ones that were asked? For instance, let's talk about that cute little switchknife.
You know, the one that fine, upright kid admitted buying.","NO. 8: All right. Let's talk about it. Let's get it in here and look at it. I'd like to see it again, Mr. Foreman.","[The foreman looks at him questioningly and then gets up and goes to the door. During the following dialogue
the foreman knocks; the guard comes in; the foreman whispers to him; the guard nods and leaves, locking the
door.]","NO. 3: I never saw a guiltier man in my life. You sat right in court and heard the same thing I did. The man's a
dangerous killer. You could see it.",1

think?",NO. 4: The gentleman has a right to see exhibits in evidence.,NO. 3: (shrugging). Okay with me.,"NO. 4: (to NO. 8). This knife is a pretty strong piece of evidence, don't you agree?",NO. 8: We're waiting.,NO. 8: I do.,2
26,NO. 4: The boy admits going out of his house at eight o'clock after being slapped by his father.,NO. 8: Or punched.,"NO. 4: Or punched. He went to a neighborhood store and bought a switch knife. The storekeeper was arrested
the following day when he admitted selling it to the boy. It's a very unusual knife. The storekeeper identified it
and said it was the only one of its kind he had in stock. Why did the boy get it? (Sarcastically) As a present for
a friend of his, he says. Am I right so far?",NO. 8: Right.,"NO. 3: (angry). He's an old man. You saw him. Half the time he was confused. How could he be positive about
anything?",NO. 3: You bet he's right. (To all) Now listen to this man. He knows what he's talking about.,2
27,"NO. 4: Next, the boy claims that on the way home the knife must have fallen through a hole in his coat pocket,
that he never saw it again. Now there's a story, gentlemen. You know what actually happened. The boy took the
knife home and a few hours later stabbed his father with it and even remembered to wipe off the fingerprints.","[The door opens, and the guard walks in with an oddly designed knife with a tag on it. NO. 4 gets up and takes
it from him. The guard exits.]","NO. 4: Everyone connected with the case identified this knife. Now are you trying to tell me that someone
picked it up off the street and went up to the boy's house and stabbed his father with it just to be amusing?","NO. 8: No, I'm saying that it's possible that the boy lost the knife and that someone else stabbed his father with
a similar knife. It's possible.",NO. 5: I... I don't know.,[NO. 4 flips open the knife and jams it into the table.],2
28,"NO. 4: Take a look at that knife. It's a very strange knife. I've never seen one like it before in my life and neither
had the storekeeper who sold it to him.",[NO. 8 reaches casually into his pocket and withdraws an object. No one notices this. He stands up quietly.],NO. 4: Aren't you trying to make us accept a pretty incredible coincidence?,NO. 8: I'm not trying to make anyone accept it. I'm just saying it's possible.,FOREMAN: Now hold it.,NO. 3: (shouting). And I'm saying it's not possible.,2

exactly alike. There are several gasps and everyone stares at the knife. There is a long silence.]",NO. 3: (slowly amazed) What are you trying to do?,"NO. 10: (loudly) Yeah, what is this?

ten knives like that, so what?",NO. 8: Maybe there are.,"NO. 9: This is not easy. So far, it's only a feeling I have, a feeling. Perhaps you don't understand.",1

Do you?,NO. 4: You don't have to ask me that. You know my answer. He lied.,"NO. 3: All right. There's your angle. Take a look at it. Down and in. That's how I'd stab a taller man in the
chest, and that's how it was done. Take a look at it and tell me I'm wrong.",1

stays perfectly still as one by one they fold the ballots and pass them, along to the foreman. The foreman takes
them, riffles through the folded ballots, counts eleven, and now begins to open them. He reads each one out

He is wearing English spectacles and a small gray English mustache. Beside him, inanother English armchair, Mrs. Smith, an Englishwoman, is darning some English socks. A long moment of Englishsilence. The English clock strikes 17 English strokes.","MRS. SMITH : There, it’s nine o’clock. We’ve drunk the soup, and eaten the fish and chips, and the English salad.The children have drunk English water. We’ve eaten well this evening. That’s because we live in the suburbs ofLondon and because our name is Smith.","MR. SMITH: [continues to read, clicks his tongue.]","MRS. SMITH: Potatoes are very good fried in fat; the salad oil was not rancid. The oil from the grocer at the corner is better quality than the oil from the grocer at the bottom of the street. However, I prefer not to tell them that their oil is bad.","MRS. SMITH: My uncle lives in the country, but that's none of the midwife's business.","MR. SMITH: [continues to read, clicks his tongue]",2
1,"MR. SMITH:       [continues to read, clicks his tongue]","MRS. SMITH: Mary did the potatoes very well, this evening. The last time she did not do them well. I do not likethem when they are well done.","MR. SMITH:       [continues to read, clicks his tongue]","MRS. SMITH: The fish was fresh. It made my mouth water. I had two helpings. No, three helpings. That made mego to the w.c. You also had three helpings. However, the third time you took less than the first two times, while as forme, I took a great deal more . I eat better than you this evening. Why is that? Usually, it is you who eats more. It isnot appetite you lack.",MR. SMITH:      [clicks his tongue],MR. SMITH: Crocodile!,1
2,"MRS. SMITH: Our little boy wanted to drink some beer; he’s going to love getting tiddly. He’s like you. At table didyou notice how he stared at the bottle? But I poured some water from the jug into his glass. He was thirsty and hedrank it. Helen is like me: she's a good manager, thrifty, plays the piano. She never asks to drink English beer. She'slike our little daughter who drinks only milk and eats only porridge. It's obvious that she's only two. She's namedPeggy. The quince and bean pie was marvelous. It would have been nice, perhaps, to have had a small glass ofAustralian Burgundy with the sweet, but I did not bring the bottle to the table because I did not wish to set the childrena bad example of gluttony. They must learn to be sober and temperate.","MR. SMITH [continues to read, clicks his tongue.]","MRS. SMITH: Mrs. Parker knows a Rumanian grocer by the name of Popesco Rosenfeld, who has just come fromConstantinople. He is a great specialist in yogurt. He has a diploma from the school of yogurt-making in Adrianople.Tomorrow I shall buy a large pot of native Rumanian yogurt from him. One doesn't often find such things here in thesuburbs of London.","MR. SMITH [continues to read, clicks his tongue.]",MRS. MARTIN: It's harder in the case of fires. The tariffs are too high!,"MRS. SMITH: Yogurt is excellent for the stomach, the kidneys, the appendicitis, and apotheosis. It was DoctorMackenzie-King who told me that, he's the one who takes care of the children of our neighbors, the Johns. He's a gooddoctor. One can trust him. He never prescribes any medicine that he's not tried out on himself first. Before operating onParker, he had his own liver operated on first, although he was not the least bit ill.",2
3,MRS. SMITH: Because the operation was successful in the doctor's case and it was not in Parker's.,MR. SMITH: Then Mackenzie is not a good doctor. The operation should have succeeded with both of them or elseboth should have died.,MRS. SMITH: Why?,"MR. SMITH: A conscientious doctor must die with his patient if they can't get well together. The captain of a ship goesdown with his ship into the briny deep, he does not survive alone.","MR. SMITH: And what is even more interesting is the fact that firemen's stories are all true, and they're based onexperience.",MRS. SMITH: One cannot compare a patient with a ship.,2
4,"MRS. SMITH: Ah! I hadn't thought of that. ..Perhaps it is true. ..And then, what conclusion do you draw from this?","MR. SMITH: All doctors are quacks. And all patients, too. Only the Royal Navy is honest in England.",MRS. SMITH: But not sailors.,MR. SMITH: Naturally [A pause. Still reading his paper:] Here's a thing I don't understand. In the newspaper theyalways give the age of deceased persons but never the age of the newly born. That doesn't make sense.,"FIRE CHIEF: Eh, well—is there a fire here?",MRS. SMITH: I never thought of that![Another moment of silence. The clock strikes seven times. Silence. The clock strikes three times. Silence. The clockdoesn't strike.],2
5,"MRS. SMITH: My God, the poor man! When did he die?",MR. SMITH: Why do you pretend to be astonished? You know very well that he's been dead these past two years.Surely you remember that we attended his funeral a year and a half ago.,"MRS. SMITH: Oh yes, of course I do remember. I remembered it right away, but I don't understand why you yourselfwere so surprised to see it in the paper.",MR. SMITH: It wasn't in the paper. It's been three years since his death was announced. I remembered it through anassociation of ideas.,"MRS. SMITH: In real life, one must look out of the window.",MRS. SMITH: What a pity! He was so well preserved.,2
6,MRS. SMITH: Poor Bobby.,MR. SMITH: Which poor Bobby do you mean?,"MRS. SMITH: It is his wife that I mean. She is called Bobby too, Bobby Watson. Since they both had the same name,you could never tell one from the other when you saw them together. It was only after his death that you could reallytell which was which. And there are still people today who confuse her with the deceased and offer their condolencesto him. Do you know her?","MR. SMITH: I only met her once, by chance, at Bobby's burial.",MRS. SMITH: I've never seen her. Is she pretty?,"MR. SMITH: Goodness, someone is ringing. There must be someone there.",1
7,"MRS. SMITH: And when do they plan to be married, those two?","MR. SMITH: Next spring, at the latest.","MRS. SMITH: We shall have to go to their wedding, I suppose.",MR. SMITH: We shall have to give them a wedding present. I wonder what?,MRS. SMITH: Are you referring to Bobby Watson the commercial traveler?,MRS. SMITH: Why don't we give them one of the seven silver salvers that were given us for our wedding and whichhave never been of any use to us? [Silence.],2
8,"MR. SMITH: Fortunately, they had no children.","MRS. SMITH: That was all they needed! Children! Poor woman, how could she have managed!",MR. SMITH: She's still young. She might very well remarry. She looks so well in mourning.,MRS. SMITH: But who would take care of the children? You know very well that they have a boy and a girl. What aretheir names?,"MR. SMITH: Bobby and Bobby like their parents. Bobby Watson's uncle, old Bobby Watson, is a rich man and veryfond of the boy. He might very well pay for Bobby's education.","MR. MARTIN: Paper is for writing, the cat's for the rat. Cheese is for scratching.",1
9,"MR. SMITH: Yes, a cousin of Bobby Watson's.",MRS. SMITH: Who? Bobby Watson?,MR. SMITH: Which Bobby Watson do you mean?,"MRS. SMITH: Why, Bobby Watson, the son of old Bobby Watson, the late Bobby Watson's other uncle.","MR. SMITH: No, it's not that one, it's someone else. It's Bobby Watson, the son of old Bobby Watson, the late BobbyWatson's aunt.",MR. SMITH: I'll go.[Mrs. Smith shrugs her shoulders. Mrs. Martin tosses her head.],1
10,MR. SMITH: All the Bobby Watsons are commercial travelers.,"MRS. SMITH: What a difficult trade! However, they do well at it.","MR. SMITH: Yes, when there's no competition.",MRS. SMITH: And when is there no competition?,"MRS. MARTIN: No, unfortunately.","MR. SMITH: On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Tuesdays.",2
11,"MR. SMITH: He rests, he sleeps.",MRS. SMITH: But why doesn't he work those three days if there's no competition?,MR. SMITH: I don't know everything. I can't answer all your idiotic questions!,MRS. SMITH [offended]: Oh! Are you trying to humiliate me?,MR. SMITH: And the newspaper.,MR. SMITH [all smiles]: You know very well that I'm not.,2
12,"MR. SMITH: But what would you say if you saw men acting like women do, smoking all day long, powdering,rouging their lips, drinking whisky?","MRS. SMITH: It's nothing to me! But if you're only saying that to annoy me ...I don't care for that kind of joking, youknow that very well![She hurls the socks across the stage and shows her teeth. She gets up.*]","MR. SMITH [also getting up and going towards his wife, tenderly]: Oh, my little ducky daddles, what a little spitfireyou are! You know that I only said it as a joke! [He takes her by the waist and kisses her.] What a ridiculous pair ofold lovers we are! Come, let's put out the lights and go bye-byes.","MARY [entering]: I'm the maid. I have spent a very pleasant afternoon. I've been to the cinema with a man and I'veseen a film with some women. After the cinema, we went to drink some brandy and milk and then read the newspaper.","MARY: I hope, madam and sir will excuse me ...and these ladies and gentlemen too. ..I would like. ..I would like ...totell you a story, myself.","MRS. SMITH: I hope that you've spent a pleasant afternoon, that you went to the cinema with a man and that youdrank some brandy and milk.",2
13,"MARY: Mr. and Mrs. Martin, your guests, are at the door. They were waiting for me. They didn't dare come in bythemselves. They were supposed to have dinner with you this evening.","MRS. SMITH: Oh, yes. We were expecting them. And we were hungry. Since they didn't put in an appearance, wewere going to start dinner without them. We've had nothing to eat all day. You should not have gone out!",MARY: But it was you who gave me permission.,"MR. SMITH: We didn't do it on purpose.* In Nicolas Bataille's production, Mrs. Smith did not show her teeth, nor.did she throw the socks very far.","FIRE CHIEF [he is of course in uniform and is wearing an enormous shining helmet]: Good evening, ladies andgentlemen. [The Smiths and the Martins are still slightly astonished. Mrs. Smith turns her head away, in a temper, anddoes not reply to his greeting.] Good evening, Mrs. Smith. You appear to be angry.","MARY [bursts into laughter, then she bursts into tears. Then she smiles]: I bought me a chamber pot.",2
14,"MARY: Why have you come so late! You are not very polite. People should be punctual. Do you understand? But sitdown there, anyway, and wait now that you're here.[She exits. Mr. and Mrs. Martin sit facing each other, without speaking. They smile timidly at each other. The dialoguewhich follows must be spoken in voices that are drawling, monotonous, a little singsong, without nuances.*]","MR. MARTIN: Excuse me, madam, but it seems to me, unless I'm mistaken, that I've met you somewhere before.","MRS. MARTIN: I, too, sir. It seems to me that I've met you somewhere before.","MR. MARTIN: Was it, by any chance, at Manchester that I caught a glimpse of you, madam?MRS. MAR TIN: That is very possible. I am originally from the city of Manchester. But I do not have a good memory,sir. I cannot say whether it was there that I caught a glimpse of you or not!","MR. MARTIN: Good God, that's curious! I, too, am originally from the city of Manchester, madam!","MRS. SMITH: Who, What?",1
15,"MR. MARTIN: Isn't that curious! Only, I, madam, I left the city of Manchester about five weeks ago.","MRS. MARTIN: That is curious! What a bizarre coincidence! I, too, sir, I left the city of Manchester about five weeksago.","MR. MARTIN: Madam, I took the 8:30 morning train which arrives in London at 4:45.","MRS. MARTIN: That is curious! How very bizarre! And what a coincidence! I took the same train, sir, I too.","MR. MARTIN: Bizarre, beaux-arts, brassieres!","MR. MARTIN: Good Lord, how curious! Perhaps then, madam, it was on the train that I saw you?     *In Nicolas Bataille's production, this dialogue was spoken in a tone and played in a style sincerely tragic.",2
16,"MR. MARTIN: I traveled second class, madam. There is no second class in England, but I always travel second class.","MRS. MARTIN: That is curious! How very bizarre! And what a coincidence! I, too, sir, I traveled second class.","MR. MARTIN: How curious that is! Perhaps we did meet in second class, my dear lady!","MRS. MARTIN: That is certainly possible, and it is not at all unlikely. But I do not remember very well, my dear sir!","MARY: I'm going to recite a poem, then, is that agreed? It is a poem entitled ""The Fire"" in honor of the Fire Chief:                                                      The Fire                                       The polypoids were burning in the wood                                                 A stone caught fire                                                The castle caught fire                                                The forest caught fire                                                The men caught fire                                               The women caught fire                                                The birds caught fire                                                 The fish caught fire                                                The water caught fire                                                 The sky caught fire                                                The ashes caught fire                                               The smoke caught fire                                                 The fire caught fire                                               Everything caught fire![She recites the poem while the Smiths are pushing her offstage]","MR. MARTIN: My seat was in coach No.8, compartment 6, my dear lady.",2
17,"MR. MARTIN: How curious that is and what a bizarre coincidence! Perhaps we met in compartment 6, my dear lady?","MRS. MARTIN: It is indeed possible, after all! But I do not recall it, my dear sir!","MR. MARTIN: To tell the truth, my dear lady, I do not remember it either, but it is possible that we caught a glimpseof each other there, and as I think of it, it seems to me even very likely.","MRS. MARTIN: Oh! truly, of course, truly, sir!","MR. MARTIN: How curious it is! I had seat No.3, next to the window, my dear lady.","FIRE CHIEF: Don't get excited. You tell me, Mrs. Smith.",1
18,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is! It is possible, but I do not recall it, sir!","MR. MARTIN: To tell the truth, my dear lady, I do not remember it either. However, it is very possible that we saweach other on that occasion.","MRS. MARTIN: It is true, but I am not at all sure of it, sir.","MR. MARTIN: Dear madam, were you not the lady who asked me to place her suitcase in the luggage rack and whothanked me and gave me permission to smoke?",MRS. SMITH: And I was saying that each time the doorbell rings there is never anyone there.,"MRS. MARTIN: But of course, that must have been I, sir. How curious it is, how curious it is, and what a coincidence!",2
19,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is and what a coincidence! It is indeed possible, my dear sir! However, I do notbelieve that I recall it.","MR. MARTIN: Nor do I, madam. [A moment of silence. The clock strikes twice, then once.] Since coming to London, Ihave resided in Bromfield Street, my dear lady.","MRS. MARTIN: How curious that is, how bizarre! I, too, since coming to London, I have resided in Bromfield Street,my dear sir.","MR. MARTIN: How curious that is, well then, well then, perhaps we have seen each other in Bromfield Street, mydear lady.","MRS. MARTIN: How curious that is, how bizarre! It is indeed possible, after all!

21,"MRS. MARTIN: What a coincidence, good Lord, what a coincidence! My bedroom, too, has a bed with a greeneiderdown and is at the end of the corridor, between the w.c., dear sir, and the bookcase!","MR. MARTIN: How bizarre, curious, strange! Then, madam, we live in the same room and we sleep in the same bed,dear lady. It is perhaps there that we have met!","MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is and what a coincidence! It is indeed possible that we have met there, and perhapseven last night. But I do not recall it, dear sir!","MR. MARTIN: I have a little girl, my little daughter, she lives with me, dear lady.

MARTIN: What a bizarre coincidence! I, too, have a little girl. She is two years old, has a white eye and a redeye, she is very pretty, and her name is Alice, too, dear sir!",2
22,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is! It is indeed possible, dear sir. [A rather long moment of silence. The clock strikes29 times.]","MR. MARTIN [after having reflected at length, gets up slowly and, unhurriedly, moves toward Mrs. Martin, who,surprised by his solemn air, has also gotten up very quietly. Mr. Martin, in the same flat, monotonous voice, slightlysing- song]: Then, dear lady, I believe that there can be no doubt about it, we have seen each other before and you aremy own wife. ..Elizabeth, I have found you again![Mrs. Martin approaches Mr. Martin without haste. They embrace without expression. The clock strikes once, veryloud. This striking of the clock must be so loud that it makes the audience jump. The Martins do not hear it.]","MRS. MARTIN: Donald, it's you, darling![They sit together in the same armchair, their arms around each other, and fall asleep. The clock strikes several moretimes. Mary, on tiptoe, a finger to her lips, enters quietly and addresses the audience.]","MARY: Elizabeth and Donald are now too happy to be able to hear me. I can therefore let you in on a secret. Elizabethis not Elizabeth, Donald is not Donald. And here is the proof: the child that Donald spoke of is not Elizabeth'sdaughter, they are not the same person. Donald's daughter has one white eye and one red eye like Elizabeth's daughter.Whereas Donald's child has a white right eye and a red left eye, Elizabeth's child has a red right eye and a white lefteye! Thus all of Donald's system of deduction collapses when it comes up against this last obstacle which destroys hiswhole theory. In spite of the extraordinary coincidences which seem to be definitive proofs, Donald and Elizabeth, notbeing the parents of the same child, are not Donald and Elizabeth. It is in vain that he thinks he is Donald, it is in vainthat she thinks she is Elizabeth. He believes in vain that she is Elizabeth. She believes in vain that he is Donald -theyare sadly deceived. But who is the true Donald? Who is the true Elizabeth? Who has any interest in prolonging thisconfusion? I don't know. Let's not try to know. Let's leave things as they are.

After several seconds, Mr. and Mrs. Martin separate and take the chairs they hadat the beginning.]",FIRE CHIEF: No.,"MR. MARTIN: Darling, let's forget all that has not passed between us, and, now that we have found each other again,let's try not to lose each other any more, and live as before.",2
23,"MRS. SMITH: Good evening, dear friends! Please forgive us for having made you wait so long. We thought that weshould extend you the courtesy to which you are entitled and as soon as we learned that you had been kind enough togive us the pleasure of coming to see us without prior notice we hurried to dress for the occasion.","MR. SMITH [furious]: We've had nothing to eat all day. And we've been waiting four whole hours for you. Why haveyou come so late?[Mr. and Mrs. Smith sit facing their guests. The striking of the clock underlines the speeches, more or less strongly,according to the case. The Martins, particularly Mrs. Martin, seem embarrassed and timid. For this reason theconversation begins with, difficulty and the words are uttered, at the be ginning, awkwardly. A long embarrassedsilence at first, then other silences and hesitations follow.]",MR.

[He glances at Mrs. Smith and the Martins, who are allsurprise.] It's the Fire Chief!","FIRE CHIEF [he is of course in uniform and is wearing an enormous shining helmet]: Good evening, ladies andgentlemen. [The Smiths and the Martins are still slightly astonished. Mrs. Smith turns her head away, in a temper, anddoes not reply to his greeting.] Good evening, Mrs. Smith. You appear to be angry.",MRS. SMITH: Oh!,"MR. MARTIN: I traveled second class, madam. There is no second class in England, but I always travel second class.",1
38,"MR. MARTIN: There's been an argument between Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Mr. Fire Chief.",MRS. SMITH [to Mr. Martin]: This is no business of yours![To Mr. Smith:] I beg you not to involve outsiders in our family arguments.,"MR. SMITH: Oh, my dear, this is not so serious. The Fire Chief is an old friend of the family. His mother courted me,and I knew his father. He asked me to give him my daughter in marriage if ever I had one. And he died waiting.MR. MAR TIN: That's neither his fault, nor yours.","FIRE CHIEF: Well, what is it all about?","MRS. MARTIN: What I think is that a maid, after all--even though it's none of my business-is never anything but amaid...",MRS. SMITH: My husband was claiming. ..,2
39,"MR. MARTIN: Yes, it was she.","MRS. MARTIN: No, it was he.","FIRE CHIEF: Don't get excited. You tell me, Mrs. Smith.","MRS. SMITH: Well, this is how it was. It is difficult for me to speak openly to you, but a fireman is also a confessor.","MR. MARTIN [musing]: How curious it is, how curious it is, how curious it is, and what a coincidence! You know, inmy bedroom there is a bed, and it is covered with a green eiderdown. This room, with the bed and the green eiderdown,is at the end of the corridor between the w.c. and the bookcase, dear lady!",FIRE CHIEF: Well then?,2
40,MR. MARTIN: It is plausible.,MRS. SMITH: And I was saying that each time the doorbell rings there is never anyone there.,MRS. MARTIN: It might seem strange.,"MRS. SMITH: But it has been proved, not by theoretical demonstrations, but by facts.",MR. MARTIN: We all have colds. [Silence.],"MR. SMITH: That's false, since the Fire Chief is here. He rang the bell, I opened the door, and there he was.",2
41,MR. MARTIN: But just now.,"MRS. SMITH: Yes, but it was only when you heard the doorbell ring the fourth time that there was someone there.And the fourth time does not count.",MRS. MARTIN: Never. It is only the first three times that count.,"MR. SMITH: Mr. Fire Chief, permit me in my turn to ask you several questions.",FIRE CHIEF: Go right ahead.,"MRS. MARTIN: Yes, darling.[Mr. and Mrs. Smith enter from the right, wearing the same clothes.]",1
42,"FIRE CHIEF: Yes, it was I.",MR. MARTIN: You were at the door? And you rang in order to be admitted?,FIRE CHIEF: I do not deny it.,"MR. SMITH [to his wife, triumphantly]: You see? I was right. When you hear the doorbell ring, that means someonerang it. You certainly cannot say that the Fire Chief is not someone.","MRS. SMITH: Certainly not. I repeat to you that I was speaking of only the first three times, since the fourth time doesnot count.",MR. MARTIN: An Englishman's home is truly his castle.,1
43,"FIRE CHIEF: No, it was not I.",MRS. MARTIN: You see? The doorbell rang and there was no one there.,MR. MARTIN: Perhaps it was someone else?,MR. SMITH: Were you standing at the door for a long time?,"MRS. MARTIN: How curious it is, good Lord, how bizarre!And what a coincidence! I too reside on the fifth floor, in flat No.8, dear sir!",FIRE CHIEF: Three-quarters of an hour.,2
44,FIRE CHIEF: No one. I am sure of that.,MRS. MARTIN: And did you hear the bell when it rang the second time?,"FIRE CHIEF: Yes, and that wasn't I either. And there was still no one there.",MRS. SMITH: Victory! I was right.,MR. SMITH [to his wife]: Not so fast. [To the Fire Chief:] And what were you doing at the door?,MRS. MARTIN: I think so too.,1
45,MR. MARTIN [to the Fire Chief]: But the third time--it was not you who rang?,"FIRE CHIEF: Yes, it was I.",MR. SMITH: But when the door was opened nobody was in sight.,FIRE CHIEF: That was because I had hidden myself—as a joke.,"MRS. SMITH: Don't make jokes, Mr. Fire Chief. This business is too sad.",MR. SMITH: I've been goosed.,1
46,MRS. SMITH: Never anyone.,MR. SMITH: Always someone.,"FIRE CHIEF: I am going to reconcile you. You both are partly right. When the doorbell rings, sometimes there issomeone, other times there is no one.",MR. MARTIN: This seems logical to me.,MRS. MARTIN: I think so too.,MR. SMITH: The truth lies somewhere between the two [Silence],1
47,MRS. SMITH: We just kissed each other a little while ago.,MR. MARTIN: They'll kiss each other tomorrow. They have plenty of time.,"MRS. SMITH: Mr. Fire Chief, since you have helped us settle this, please make yourself comfortable, take off yourhelmet and sit down for a moment.","FIRE CHIEF: Excuse me, but I can't stay long. I should like to remove my helmet, but I haven't time to sit down. [Hesits down, without removing his helmet.] I must admit that I have come to see you for another reason.

FIRE CHIEF: I must beg you to excuse my indiscretion [terribly embarrassed] ...uhm [He points a finger at theMartins] ...you don't mind. ..in front of them...",FIRE CHIEF: Nothing. I was just standing there. I was thinking of many things.,1
48,MR. MARTIN: We're old friends. They tell us everything. MR. SMITH: Speak.,"FIRE CHIEF: Eh, well—is there a fire here?",MRS. SMITH: Why do you ask us that?,FIRE CHIEF: It's because—pardon me—I have orders to extinguish all the fires in the city.,MRS. MARTIN: All?,"MRS. MARTIN: B, c, d, f g, 1, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, x, z!",1

50,FIRE CHIEF [to the Martins]: And there's nothing burning at your house either?,"MRS. MARTIN: No, unfortunately.",MR. MARTIN [to the Fire Chie/]: Things aren't going ~ well just now.,"FIRE CHIEF: Very poorly. There's been almost nothing, a few trifles-a chimney, a barn. Nothing important. It doesn'tbring in much. And since there are no returns, the profits on output are very meager.",MARY: I was going to tell you...,"MR. SMITH: Times are bad. That's true all over. It's the same this year with business and agriculture as it is with fires,nothing is prospering.",2
51,FIRE CHIEF: No floods either.,MRS. SMITH: But there is some sugar.,MR. SMITH: That's because it is imported.,MRS. MARTIN: It's harder in the case of fires. The tariffs are too high!,"FIRE CHIEF: All the same, there's an occasional asphyxiation by gas, but that's unusual too. For instance, a youngwoman asphyxiated herself last week—she had left the gas on.",MRS. SMITH: She always wears her hair in the same style.,1
52,"FIRE CHIEF: No, but she thought it was her comb.",MR. SMITH: These confusions are always dangerous!,MRS. SMITH: Did you go to see the match dealer?,FIRE CHIEF: There's nothing doing there. He is insured against fires.,MRS. MARTIN: He was tying his shoe lace which had come undone.,"MR. MARTIN: Why don't you go see the Vicar of Wakefield, and use my name?",2
53,MR. SMITH: Go see the Durands.,"FIRE CHIEF: I can't do that either. He's not English. He's only been naturalized. And naturalized citizens have theright to have houses, but not the right to have them put out if they're burning.","MRS. SMITH: Nevertheless, when they set fire to it last year, it was put out just the same.",FIRE CHIEF: He did that all by himself. Clandestinely. But it's not I who would report him.,MR. SMITH: Neither would I.,"MRS. MARTIN: B, c, d, f g, 1, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, x, z!",1
54,FIRE CHIEF: Shall I tell you some stories?,"MRS. SMITH: Oh, by all means, how charming of you. [She kisses him.]","MR. SMITH, MRS. MARTIN, MR. MARTIN: Yes, yes, some stories, hurrah![They applaud.]","MR. SMITH: And what is even more interesting is the fact that firemen's stories are all true, and they're based onexperience.","FIRE CHIEF: I speak from my own experience. Truth, nothing but the truth. No fiction.","MR. MARTIN: The ceiling is above, the floor is below.",1
55,MRS. SMITH: Begin!,MR. MARTIN: Begin!,"MRS. MARTIN: Be quiet, he is beginning.","FIRE CHIEF [coughs slightly several times]: Excuse me, don't look at me that way. You embarrass me. You know thatI am shy.","MRS. SMITH: A schoolmaster teaches his pupils to read, but the cat suckles her young when they are small.",MRS. SMITH: Isn't he charming! [she kisses him.],2
56,MRS. MARTIN: But if we don't listen to you we won't hear you.,FIRE CHIEF: I didn't think of that!,"MRS. SMITH: I told you, he's just a boy.","MR. MARTIN, MR. SMITH: Oh, the sweet child! [They kiss him.*]",MRS. MARTIN: Chin up!,MRS. SMITH: Benjamin Franklin was right; you are more nervous than he.,1
57,MRS. MARTIN: What is the moral?,FIRE CHIEF: That's for you to find out.,MR. SMITH: He's right.,MRS. SMITH [furious]: Tell us another.,"FIRE CHIEF: A young calf had eaten too much ground glass. As a result, it was obliged to give birth. It brought forth acow into the world. However, since the calf was male, the cow could not call him Mamma. Nor could she call himPapa, because the calf was too little. The calf was then obliged to get married and the registry office carried out all thedetails completely a la mode.","MRS. MARTIN: Well, I’m sure you’ll say that I’m making it up----he was down on one knee and he was bent over.",1

""Then,"" said the snake, ""give me some money."" ""Afox doesn't give money,"" replied the tricky animal, who, in order to escape, jumped down into a deep ravine full ofstrawberries and chicken honey. But the snake was there waiting for him with a Mephistophelean laugh. The fox pulledout his knife, shouting: ""I'm going to teach you how to live!"" Then he took to flight, turning his back. But he had noluck. The snake was quicker. With a well-chosen blow of his fist, he struck the fox in the middle of his forehead, whichbroke into a thousand pieces, while he cried: ""No! No! Four times no! I'm not your daughter.”*",MRS. MARTIN: It's interesting.,MRS. SMITH: It's not bad.,MR.

We begin on Christmas Eve with me, Mark, and my roommate, Roger. We
live in an industrial loft on the corner of 11th street and Avenue B, the top
floor of what was once a music publishing factory. Old rock 'n' roll posters
hang on the walls. They have Roger's picture advertising gigs at CBGB's and
the Pyramid Club. We have an illegal wood burning stove; its exhaust pipe
crawls up to a skylight. All of our electrical appliances are plugged into one
thick extension cord which snakes its way out a window. Outside, a small tent

She's had trouble with that milk and the moon ever since 
Maybe it's a female thing 
'Cause who'd want to leave Cyberland anyway?... 
Walls ain't so bad 
The dish and the spoon for instance 
They were down on their luck - knocked on my doghouse door
I said, ""Not in my backyard, utensils! Go back to China!"" 
""The only way out is up,"" Elsie whispered to me
