And my poor mother washed and scrubbed for the Yanks by the day, and my older sister sewed, and my two younger stayed at home to keep the house. We never had clothes enough to wear, nor enough food to eat. Well I remember one Thanksgiving, or maybe it was Christmas, when some 	Yank in whose house mother had been scrubbmg gave her a dollar extra for a present, and on the way home she spent It all on food.
